EyeSpyAI

EyeSpyAI is a Python-based project that combines real-time object detection and facial expression detection.  
It allows you to detect objects in images or video streams, and also read facial emotions in real-time using your webcam.  
This project demonstrates practical Computer Vision (CV) and Machine Learning (ML).

Features:
- Object Detection: Detects multiple objects in images or live video.  
- Expression Detection: Detects facial expressions like happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.  
- Works with both webcam and static images.  
- Modular design â€“ object detection and expression detection run separately for flexibility.
